## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, 
[In North Carolina, Black Votersâ€™ Mail-In Ballots Much More Likely to Be Rejected Than Those From Any Other Race](https://www.propublica.org/article/in-north-carolina-black-voters-mail-in-ballots-much-more-likely-to-be-rejected-than-those-from-any-other-race)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(refinr)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

NewVoter_data <- read_csv("data/nonvoters_data.csv",
  guess_max = 2111797) |>
  clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    voter_zip = as.character(voter_zip),
    election_dt = as.Date(election_dt)
  )
```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
NewVoter_data |>
  group_by(race, ballot_rtn_status)|>
  summarise(count = n())|>
arrange(desc(count))



# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 3

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 5

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
